Jenkins is a continuos integration tool
Continuos delivery - Releasing code process - from different environments until prod

The process of continuos development and testing is related to CI
The process of releasing developed code using release management is called CD

Jenkins will pull the code from remote repository to build and test the code

Jenkins pipeline - code, build, test and deploy
Maven goals can be achived by using jenkins
most of the time sanity and regression test cases are executed using jenkins
Jenkins will by default follow headless mode of testing


Remote repository : https://github.com/Subba-Rao-M/JavaAndSeleniumExamples.git

Install the jenkins: or run war file java -jar jenkins.war 
if port number needs to be changes java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=9090

Go to manage jenkins: install required plugins
configure maven, jdk and git paths in jenkins

Manage Jenkins - Tools - Add JDK, Git and maven paths from system and save it


For local select custom work sapce and give project file path for POM related folder
select invoke top level maven targents in build
give test -Pmaster -Dbrowser=edge 

Add the choice parameter values for -P and -D values to get values dynamically

Create different values for headless and headed browser values like chrome and chrome headless

Scheduling Jenkins Job:
Use build periodically
MIns Hr(1 to 24) Day of month month(0 to 12) dayofweek(0 to 7)
45 7 *** i.e run at 7.45
* 5 *** starts at 5AM
3rd parameter refers to day
