Selenium Grid:

Grid has 2 components: Hub and Node

Hub - > Client machine with controller from where execution starts
Node - > is remote machine where execution takes place in different environment based on setup

All nodes should be attached to hub
then all nodes can be controlled by hub
HUB controlling all nodes with corresponding browsers is called selenium grid
In HUB we will specify which OS and browser needs to be triggered

In place of using multiple VM's docker came into picture
docker hub is web site and images represent individual OS/environment 
container is like virtual machine created inside images
container will have all set up which will act as node
Single system can act as hub and node (i.e stand alone setup)
Single hub and multiple nodes(Distributed setup/mode)

Selenium Grid Setup without using Docker

Standalone Setup(Single machine)
1) Download selenium-server-version.jar in machine and place it somewhere
2)  Run below command to start selenium grid
	java -jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar standalone
3) URL to see session http://localhost:4444/ or http://<local-ip>:4444
4) Also the dash board displays how many sessions can be executed(i.e 8 chrome browsers can be run at a time) and also max concurrency

Distributes system using multiple machines(i.e if multiple VMS or machines available)
1) Download selenium-server-version.jar in machines and download it in HUB and all node machines
2) Run below command to make one machine as HUB
	java -jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar hub
3) Run below command to make one machine as node and to attach it to hub machine
	java -jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar node --hub http://<hub-ip>:4444/
4) URL to see session http://localhost:4444/
