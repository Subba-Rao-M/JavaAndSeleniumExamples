Continuos integration:
git, github and jenkins

DEV WS#N - Git - > GitHub - All dev codes from their work space will come to git hub
QA WS#N - Git - > GitHub 



Every developer will have their local repository maintained using git software
End of day all codes should be committed to local repository
Once the changes are done it should be pushed to git hub repository

Sharing the code from local repository to remote is called push
sharing the code from work space to local repository is called commit

DevOps team perform process automation using maven from git hub

DevOps - 
	1) Build Creation
	2) Run Automation
	3) Build Certification
	
	Jenkins
		Runs automation
	maven
		compile code
		run code
		test code
		package 
		install

Every day devops team perform this operation it is called nightly build
Devops team take code from development team and build it
Devops team takes automation script and runs it against build
They will certify the build if it is working or not


As a tester, every day commit the code to local repository and push the working code to github

Pre-Requists
Install git software
Create an account with github

git --version --> To check the version

Git and Github workflow:

Working Directory -> Staging Area - > Local Repository - > Remote Repository
UnTracked Files - > Tracked Files - > Committed File - > Remote File
				Add       - >     Commit    -> 				Push

initialize empty git local repository				
git init 

.git is virual and hidden and url looks like below
Location of project/.git/

Configure git with user name and password:

git config --global user.name "Subba Rao"
git config --global user.email "email id"

to list all untracked files
git status

All untracked files in red color
To add files to staging area  (All files, with specific file extention,  file name or folder)
git add - A
git add <filename>
git add *.java
git add <foldername>
file colour changes to green

commmit the code to local git repository

git commit -m "Commit Message"
file color changes to white

Create the account in github and create a repository
Copy repository URL https://github.com/Subba-Rao-M/JavaAndSeleniumExamples.git

Connect local repository to remote repository:

git remote add origin "https://github.com/Subba-Rao-M/JavaAndSeleniumExamples.git"

Push the code from local to remote repository:

git push origin master (check the branch name in remote repository)

Repeat the above add, commit and push for any additional changes in repository

To pull the latest updated code in remote repository to local repository:

git pull "https://github.com/Subba-Rao-M/JavaAndSeleniumExamples.git"


For existing project available in github and  as a new team member you need to clone the repository
Create an new folder in system
open git bash
run clone command
git clone "https://github.com/Subba-Rao-M/JavaAndSeleniumExamples.git"
Clone will be used one time when there is no project in local and create existing project
Pull is used when project is available in local to get updated code

All git commands can be executed using eclipse:

default branch is master both in local and remote
All codes will be maintained in developers own branch both in local and remote
then code will be merged to main/master branch


GitHubwebhook triggers jenkins job auotomaticall when someone pushes to github
