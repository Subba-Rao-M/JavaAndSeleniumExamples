Continuos integration:
git, github and jenkins

DEV WS#N - Git - > GitHub - All dev codes from their work space will come to git hub
QA WS#N - Git - > GitHub 



Every developer will have their local repository maintained using git software
End of day all codes should be committed to local repository
Once the changes are done it should be pushed to git hub repository

Sharing the code from local repository to remote is called push
sharing the code from work space to local repository is called commit

DevOps team perform process automation using maven from git hub

DevOps - 
	1) Build Creation
	2) Run Automation
	3) Build Certification
	
	Jenkins
		Runs automation
	maven
		compile code
		run code
		test code
		package 
		install

Every day devops team perform this operation it is called nightly build
Devops team take code from development team and build it
Devops team takes automation script and runs it against build
They will certify the build if it is working or not


As a tester, every day commit the code to local repository and push the working code to github

Pre-Requists
