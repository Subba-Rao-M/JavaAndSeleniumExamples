WebDriver Methods:

WebElements or WebObjects on which script operates

5 Types of WebDriver Methods:

1) Get Methods
2) Conditional Methods
3) Browser Methods
4) Navigational Methods
5) Wait Methods

Get Methods - we can access these methods using web driver interface and works on web pages not on elements

get(url) - > opens the URL on browser
getTitle() -> returns the title of current page
getCurrentUrl()  -> returns the url of current page
getPageSource() - > returns the source code for page --> to check some text or element present in source or not
getWindowHandle() - > returns id of single browser window - ID is generated dynamically using run time and cannot see it in DOM also and it keeps on changing
getWindowHandles() -> returns id of multiple browser windows


close() - Closes  1 browser window at a time
quit() - Closes all browser windows open at a time

if only few browser window needs to be closed then based on windowID's we need to close
get title based on windowid and swithc to it and close it
By default browser will be focused on first window only and to operate in second window user need to switch to other browser



Conditional Methods - Can be applied on web elements

returns true or false

isDisplayed() - ELement is displayed on page or not
isEnabled() - Is enabled or disabled for operational elements. i.e input fields to enter or select values or click buttons
isSelected() - used for checking if element is selected or not or value in drop down is selected or not

Browser Methods:

close()
quit()


Navigational Methods:

navigate.to() - Opens URL on the browser
navigate.back()
navigate.forward()
navigate.refresh()

Difference between

driver.get()
driver.navigate.to()

Functionality wise no difference
internal logic different
get accepts url in string format

get(String url){
}
navigate(url){
get(String url)
}

navigate(oject){
//compares if url in string or object format
it converts object to string format and then pass to get method
get()

}

get - accepts url in string format only
navigate accepts url in string format and object format
Object comes from other application and to use it navigate method is used
most of the time get method only used with string url
