Page Object Model:

is a design pattern not a framework
locators and methods related to page is maintained in separate class

Problems without POM
Duplicate locators and methods in multiple test case classes
Updating

Identify the number of pages in your application
For each page create separate class with web elements and actions method
Test case class includes test methods and validations

2 approches to create page object class:
	1) Using page factory
	2) Without using pagefactory
	
PageFactory is a class provided by selenium webdriver

Each page will have 3 sections - Constructor, page elements and action methods
