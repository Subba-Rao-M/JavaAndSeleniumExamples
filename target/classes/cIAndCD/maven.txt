Maven is a build tool

Why maven:
1. Central repository to get dependencies
2. maintaining common structure across organization
3. Flexibility in integrating with CI tools
4. Plugins for test framework

pom.xml was used to add dependencies and plugins
pom will have dependencies to include jar files required projects and
plugin are used to compile and run our projects


Artifact id: is a file/jar deployed into maven repository
group id: to identidy project uniquely
achetype: generate project based on defined structure
Artifact id is sub project of group id

to run project outside eclipse pom.xml should be used
testng.xml cannot be run outside eclipse
so it should be added to pom.xml
testng.xml should be run through pom.xml

plugins added in pom.xml
1) maven compiler plugin - > to compile the project
2) maven surefire plugin - > to run the project

Maven surefire plugin



plugins also like dependencies from apache and 

build section includes plugins and it should be places before dependencies tag

Right click on pom.xml and run as maven test
and build should be successful

maven is within available eclipse
also need to install in system or OS level to execute outside or jenkins

Install maven:
Download the maven file and extract
set maven path till bin folder in system environment path variable
before maven java latest version should be installed
check mvn -version in command prompt

Project right click and copy location in command prompt
run mvn test or mvn clean test

Crate run.bat file in project
Place cd project path
mvn test and save the file
click on run.bat file to execute the scripts



RS course:

Add profiles with maven sure plugin for each xml so that using particular name given the xml will be triggered using command prompt
P stands for profile
mvn test -PRegression
mvn test -PSmoke

D refers to browser parameter
mvn test -Dbrowser=firefox
use system.getproperty("browser")

maven commands:

clean - cleans the project by clearing all previous build execution details
compile - all files are correct with programming syntax defined
test - triggers test execution (also automatically performs clean and compile)
first checks in local for existing jars and then connects to maven repository to get jars
File name should end with word Test else maven test will not recognize the files
