Variable
	- is a container which can hold some data
	- To represent the data we need variables
	- We can change the value of variable whenever required

DataTypes:
	- What type of data is stored in variables
	- Whenever declaring variables we need to specify the data type
	- Based on data datatype is decided

Syntax:
	- DataType variable = value(optional);

Different approches of creating variables:
	int a= 100;
	int b= 200;
	int c = 300;
	//Approach 2 // if all variables are of same data type
	int a, b, c; // this will give error if written in same scope since already above it is declared as int for same variable
	a=100; b=200; c= 300;
	
	// 3d Approach
	int a=10, b = 20, c=30;
	
Different Data Types:

	- Primitive Data Types
		- byte, short, int and long - > To represent number without decimals
		- float and double 			- > To represent decimal numbers
		- char 						- > To represent single character which is placed inside ''
		- boolean 					-> To have true or false values
		- all above data types starts with small case letter
		- Primitive value can store single value at a time
		- If data type used more than required data storage, memory wasted
		- If storing higher value lower data type, - not possible
		- Prefer to use int as moderate case
		
	- Non-Primitive Data Types
		- Also called as collections or derived data types
		- String
		- ArrayList
		- HashMap
		- HashSet
		- All derived data types starts with upper case letter
		- Multiple values can be stored in single variable



		Data Type	- Size - Examples
		byte 		1 byte	int a = 100; int b=-100;
		short		2 bytes
		int 		4 bytes	
		long		8 bytes
		
		float		4 bytes	Stores maximum 7 decimal places after number
		double		8 bytes	After number 15 decimal places allowed
		
		char		2 bytes
		
		boolean		1 bit							

	
		final int a =100; final keyword is used to maintain value constant and it cannot be overridden
		

Java is statically typed programming language
Python is dynamically typed programming language

Example:

int x =100;
x="Welcome";

In java above is not allowed and where as in python dynamically data type is identified for x and it will execute.
x =100; Based on data it will consider int for x
x="Welcome"; Based on data it will consider String for x
