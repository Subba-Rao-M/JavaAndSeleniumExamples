Software Testing:
	- Release quality software to client or production
	- Process of finding defects
	- Performing testing without using any tool is manual testing
	- Challenges in Manual Testing
		- Re - testing -> Same test executed multiple times. Time consuming and testing with multiple test data
		- Regression Testing - > Development will provide builds in multiple iterations and during the process tester has to verify the previously implemented tasks working fine with new changes. 
								Existing functionality should not be broken because of new changes done by developer. 
		- Both above are time consuming and lot of efforts required
		
	- Why we need automation testing
		- To overcome the challenges faced in above automation testing tools will used
	- What is automation testing
		- Performing the testing using automation tools is called automation testing
		- Automation tools helps in automating test cases
		- Test Cases - step by step action need to perform to test the application to verify the expected and actual results are same
		- Automation tester will convert the above manual test case into automation test script
		- Programming language supported by tools provide instruction to tool
		- Using cyclic automation of test cases which reduces dependency on existing manual test cases

Selenium:
	- Selenium is a web based automation tool or library
	- Selenium is a collection of components like IDE, WebDriver and Grid
	- Advantages:
		- Open Source and Fee
		- Supports multiple OS, Browsers, Languages
		- Integration with 3rd party tools
	- Disadvantages
		- window based applications not supported(Use AutoIT, Silkui, robot api)
		- No builtin report(testng, extent and allure reports)
		- Cannot support excel files(Apache poi)
		- Graphs and Capcha automation

Programming Types:

	- Structured - C, C++

Java:

	- JDK -- Java Development kit
				- Comes along with JRE and JVM
				- Used to develop java code
	- JRE -- Java run time environment
				- Subset of JDK
				- Can be installed separately
				- Required to run java programs
	- JVM -- Java virtual environment
				- Heart of Java
				- Complies and convert java program written into byte code which machine understands
				- Cannot install separately
				- Complies code and checks if any syntax error
				- Executes code and provides result
	- Set Environment variable for java path in path or can add Java_home and add it to path
	- java -version - > To know the installed java version
