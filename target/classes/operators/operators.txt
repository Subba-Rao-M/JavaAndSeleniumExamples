Operators:

Operator is a symbol which will perform operations

int a =10;
int b=20;
int c = a+b;

a and b are called operands and =and+ are called operators

Types for Operators:
Arithmetic Operators : +, -, *, / and % 
Relation or Comparison Operator : >, >=, <, <=, != and ==
Logical Operators : && , || and !
Increment and Decrement Operator: ++ and --
Assignment Operator: =, +=, -=, *=, /= and %=
Conditional or Ternary Operator: ?:


Difference between == and =

== is comparison operator which will return true or false
= is assignment operator which will assign the value to the variable


once again above operators are devided into 3 categories

Unary Operators 
	- Operates with single variable
	- =, +=, -=, *=, /= and %=, ++ and --, !
Binary Operators
	- Two variables required
	- All arithmetic, logical operators excluding !, relation operators
Ternary Operators - 
	- THREE variables required
