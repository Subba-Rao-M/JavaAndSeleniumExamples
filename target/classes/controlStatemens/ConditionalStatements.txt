Control Statements:

Conditional Statements
	- If statement
	- If and else statement
	- nested if else statement
	- Switch Case statement
Looping iterative statement
	- while loop
	- do while loop
	- for loop
	- for each loop
Jumping Statements

Switch(variable){
Case value1: Statements;
Case value2: Statements;
Default: Statements
}


loops:

Initialization - starting point
Conditions -- How many times we have to repeat
Increment/Decrement  - By how much


while(condition){
statement
increment/decrement
}

do{
Statements;
increment/decrement;

}while(condition);

Only do while loop has ; at the end to halt the statement

In while loop first condition is checked and then statements executed
In do while loop statements will be executed first at least one time and for next iteration condition is checked

For loop -- reduces lines of code 
for (initialization; condition ; increment/decrement){
statements;
}

Initialization executed once
then condition checked
executed statement
increment the number
Check the condition again and if pass execute the statement
increment and repeat the condition check and so on


Which loop to prefer:

if you know the number of iterations then go for for loop
if you want to execute the statement at least once the go for do while loop
If you dont know how many times to repeat the loop go with while loop




Jumping Statements:
break
continue
Used with conditional and looping statements
